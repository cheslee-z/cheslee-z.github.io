In this paper, we formulate the attitude control problem in ground mode as a continuous-state, continuousaction Markov decision process with unknown transfer probabilities. Based on deterministic policy gradient theorems and neural network approximations, we propose RBSACÔºö a model-free rolling balance Reinforcement Learning (RL) controller based on Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, which learns the state feedback controller from the attitude sampling of the ground mode. To improve the performance of the algorithm, we further integrate a batch learning method by playing back previously prioritized trajectories. We illustrate through simulations that our model-free approach RBSAC outperforms a feedback-based linear PID controller. After conducting simulation verification, it has been observed that the RBSAC controller enables stable rolling of the UAR on the ground, resulting in a 60% improvement in speed compared to the PID controller. Moreover, the RBSAC controller exhibits enhanced robustness and autonomous response to external disturbances during motion.","tags":null,"title":"RBSAC: Rolling Balance Controller Based on Soft Actor-Critic Algorithm of the Unicycle Air Robot","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chenlong Zhang","Dawei Li","Haodong Li"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1675123200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675123200,"objectID":"61d5d5a037297575b97f871b743caae1","permalink":"https://cheslee_z.github.io/publication/icgnc/","publishdate":"2023-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icgnc/","section":"publication","summary":"Fixed-wing Miniature Air Vehicle (MAV) is not only coupled with longitudinal motion, but also more susceptible to wind disturbance due to its lighter weight, which brings more challenges to its altitude and airspeed controller design. Therefore, in this paper, an improved longitudinal control strategy based on energy state, is proposed to address the above-mentioned issues. The control strategy utilizes the Linear Extended State Observer (LESO) to observe the energy states and the disturbance of the MAV, and then designs a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) controller based on a more coordinated Total Energy Control (TEC) strategy to control the airspeed and altitude of the MAV. The performance of this control strategy has been successfully verified in a Model-in-the-Loop (MIL) simulation with Simulink, and a comparative test with the classical TEC algorithm is carried out.","tags":null,"title":"Robust Coordinated Longitudinal Control of MAV Based on Energy State","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Based on Gazebo, PX4 and ROS, we built a simulation system to verify the visual navigation function of UAV.\n","date":1648771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648771200,"objectID":"2c23b91a238c7a35b774efd651fe380d","permalink":"https://cheslee_z.github.io/project/uav_navigation/","publishdate":"2022-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/uav_navigation/","section":"project","summary":"Based on Gazebo, PX4 and ROS, we built a simulation system to verify the visual navigation function of UAV.","tags":["SLAM"],"title":"Autonomous Navigation of UAVs in Dynamic Environments","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We explore the transformation between the energy states and the control actuators, and improve the basic architecture of TEC in conjunction with Linear Active Disturbance Rejection Control (LADRC) for stronger robustness.
